    "The school bell rings once more as you drag yourself towards the school lobby"
    "The avast ray of people you've met today were...peculiar to say the least, but hey new people to talk to doesn't seem too bad"
    "You check the digital clock mounted on the wall right in between the elevators"
    "Huh, 12:00"
    "You pan around the lobby to notice a handful of students walking about their day, making the small lobby feel like a crowded area"
    
    main "Is it always this crowded here or what?"
    
    "You mutter under your breath, trying to get accustomed to the new environment on your first day"
    "It really seems like you've been through a lot after only spending a couple of hours here in this school"
    "Your social battery be damned"
    
    StudentL "Oh hey, its you!"
    
    "You turn around as you quickly spot Lily and her signature pink bowtie swaying about as she giddily runs towards your directions"

    Lily "Out of class, I see?"
    Lily "How was your first day of school?"

    main "Honestly, it's not that bad really, I do like the new change of scenery compared to my last school"

    Lily "That's good to hear! I'm glad you think so"
    Lily "Say, are you busy some time later? I was wondering if you'd like me to show you around at my office"
    Lily "It gets pretty boring here honestly and I'd kill for someone to talk to during my working hours"

    "Lily gives you a pretty warm and inviting smile as she waits for your response"
    "You gulp as it seems you are now obliged to answer that question"

    main "Well...I uhhhh"

    Kent "Oh hey, it's you"

    "You hear a soft voice mutter behind you, practically spooking you in the process"
    "You look behind you to spot Kent standing behind you as he attempted to catch your attention by tapping your shoulder"

    Kent "Geez...You dont need to jump like that"
    Kent "I was only tryna get your attention, are you busy?"

    "Kent looks at the person you were talking to to find Lily standing there with a deadpanned stare"

    Lily "Oh, it's you"
    Lily "I'm surprised to see you out of your dorm room for today. Thought you'd stay in again or something"

    "Kent rolls his eyes tiringly as he dismisses Lily's remarks"

    Kent "It's not like I stay in there forever"
    Kent "And I see you've met [mcName] as well"
    
    Lily "Yeah and I was asking them if they were willing to accompany me to the office to keep me company"
    Lily "Much better than staying in a dorm all day"

    Kent "So what? At least it isn't boring"

    "Lily was about to throw another remark at Kent before a mysterious hand pulls itself in front of her face to prevent her from making another witty comment"

    Fred "No shouting in the lobby, please. We're near the admissions office"

    Vino "You're worried about the admissions office? I'm worried about my ears....ugh"
    Vino "Oh hey, it's you"

    "Fred and Vino suddenly appear out of nowhere and catch your attention. Vino being the first to notice you, then follows Fred"

    Fred "Hey, I didn't seem to catch your name earlier. How's your first day of school goin?"

    main "Oh uhh, hi again. It's [mcName] by the way. School's been goin fine, I guess. Just a bit overwhelmed is all"
    main "No bullies yet, heheh.."

    "You chuckle sheepishly at the joke you've made as the four form a wall in front of you"
    "It seems like they're all acquainted with one another with you being the odd one out"

    Fred "Its all good, first days are a hassle anyhow"

    "Fred gives you a toothy grin and a thumbs up before reaching in on his bag"

    Fred "By the way, I found something that you might like"

    "Fred proceeds to hand you a button with the School's mascot printed on it"
    "You look back at Fred's bag to see a handful of other pins he has attached on it"

    main "Gee...thanks?"

    "You stash the button in your pocket, probably to use it for later"

    Vino "Fred, you can't just keep giving people buttons for free"

    Fred "They were giving them out like candy anyways, it's not like they'll complain"

    Lily "Actually, they can. The discipline office's rules stated tha-"

    Kent " {i}Erm, acshuallee they can {/i}"

    "Kent said mockingly before recieving a punch to the shoulder from Lily"

    Vino "Honestly deserved"

    Fred "Guys, Kent is literally about to fall over"
    Fred "Please stop."

    Kent "Nah bro, I'm good, dying here would be cringe"

    "Fred physically sighs as he runs his fingers through his scalp in disappointment"

    Fred "Well anyways, I was thinking of showing [mcName] around my working area, would ya like to join me?"
    
    Lily "Hold it! I asked them first"

    Vino "Actually, I believed that I asked them first when we were in the cafeteria earlier."
    Vino "Besides, I got the rest of my period time for free today before my schedule gets filled up"
    Vino "How bout you, [mcName]?"

    main "Well, I still have a few classes before my dismissal, but I mean I could technically come with after classes"

    Kent "What? I thought we were gonna hang out bro"
    
    Lily "Yeah right, and do what? Laze around rotting away in front of a screen playing games?"

    Fred "Ok, that's enough you two. We obviously all met [mcName] today and look forward to hanging out with them"
    Fred "But they're pretty new so stop overwhelming them"
    Fred "[mcName], you decide what you wanna do this afternoon. No pressure"

    "With the chaos brewing in front of you, it would be a shame if you just left them all hanging"
    "Plus, you did say to send at least a pretty good friend, and now the gods have sent you four...very chaotic...friend potential"

        "A smile grew on Fred's face as you mentioned his name followed by a sly unforseen smirk that he flashed onto the others"
        Fred "Well, sorry guys but [mcName] made their decision"

        Lily "Ughh, no fair, Fred."

        Vino "Honestly, I respect your decision. Glad you didn't choose Lily before she makes you hold her mirror while she does her makeup"

        "Lily recoiled in an appalled gasp before crossing her arms, pouting"

        Lily "I am NOT like that"
        Lily "Well...to new people"

        Vino "Whatevs, have fun. I'm gonna head to the garden to do some daily check ins"

        Kent "I'll go to the caf and buy something too, see ya around"

        Lily "Guess I'll go too then, bye [mcName]"

        "You watch as the party shrinks down to just you and Fred as the others leave to do their own thing one by one"
